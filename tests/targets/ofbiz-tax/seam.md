**Repository**: Apache OFBiz — a large Java ERP framework in which business logic is
notoriously entangled with an XML service engine, an entity (persistence) engine, and
multi-language indirection. This working copy is the target codebase.

**Seam under distillation**: sales-tax calculation.

* Primary source file (total fragment coverage required):
  `applications/accounting/src/main/java/org/apache/ofbiz/accounting/tax/TaxAuthorityServices.java`
  — public service entry points `rateProductTaxCalc` and `rateProductTaxCalcForDisplay`, and
  private workhorses `getTaxAuthorities`, `getTaxAdjustments`, `getProductPrice`,
  `setProductCategoryCond`, `handlePartyTaxExempt`.
* External contract: service definitions `calcTax`, `calcTaxForDisplay` and their interfaces
  in `applications/accounting/servicedef/services_tax.xml` — the ONLY wiring of this logic to
  the outside world.
* Persistent-schema definitions the code touches (entity definitions live in
  `applications/datamodel/entitydef/*-entitymodel.xml` and
  `framework/common/entitydef/entitymodel.xml`): TaxAuthority, TaxAuthorityRateProduct,
  TaxAuthorityRateType, TaxAuthorityAssoc, TaxAuthorityGlAccount, TaxAuthorityCategory,
  PartyTaxAuthInfo, PartyRelationship, ProductStore, Product, ProductPrice,
  ProductCategoryMember, PostalAddress, Geo, GeoAssoc, Facility, OrderAdjustment (the output
  shape).
* Load-bearing configuration: `applications/accounting/config/arithmetic.properties`
  (`salestax.calc.decimals`, `salestax.final.decimals`, `salestax.rounding`).
* Helper utilities on the control path (read as needed, no fragment coverage required):
  `GeoWorker.expandGeoRegionDeep`, `ContactMechWorker.getPostalAddressPostalCodeGeoId`,
  `ContactMechWorker.getFacilityContactMechByPurpose`, `ProductWorker.getVariantVirtualId`,
  `ProductWorker.getParentProduct`, `UtilNumber` scale/rounding readers.

**Why this seam**: a single tax calculation resolves taxing jurisdictions from a shipping
address (with geo-region containment), matches rate rules with store/category/threshold
conditions encoded as query predicates, applies party tax exemptions (with party-group
rollup and jurisdiction exemption-inheritance), handles VAT-in-price and price-with-tax
corrections, and splits order-level freight tax across items by value weight — all inline in
one 772-line class, fused with entity-engine query construction. Rule, persistence, and
architectural plumbing are the same tissue.

**Provenance-critical behaviors** (stage 5 must mine history for at least these): the party
tax-exemption rules (exemption zeroing, group rollup, exemption inheritance) and one
threshold rule (minimum item price or minimum purchase).
